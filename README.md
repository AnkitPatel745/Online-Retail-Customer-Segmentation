## DATA MODELING 
#### Silhouette analysis on K-Means Clustering

**Silhouette analysis**Â can be used to study the separation distance between the resulting clusters, as a strategy to quantifying the quality of clustering via graphical tool to plot a measure of how tightly grouped the samples in the clusters are. The silhouette plot displays a measure of how close each point in one cluster is to points in the neighboring clusters and thus provides a way to assess parameters like number of clusters visually.
Let's see below how our data perform for each K clusters groups (3, 5 and 7) in the silhouette score of each cluster, along with the center of each of the cluster discovered in the scatter plots, by amount recency and frequency.

**Silhouette Analysis**
p is the mean distance to the points in the nearest cluster that the data point is not a part of
q is the mean intra-cluster distance to all the points in its own cluster.

**The value of the silhouette score range lies between -1 to 1.**
A score closer to 1 indicates that the data point is very similar to other data points in the cluster,
A score closer to -1 indicates that the data point is not similar to the data points in its cluster.

# Hierarchical Clustering
Hierarchical clustering involves creating clusters that have a predetermined ordering from top to bottom. For example, all files and folders on the hard disk are organized in a hierarchy. There are two types of hierarchical clustering,
* Divisive
* Agglomerative
